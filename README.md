# Novel Foods Risk Assessment Data Modelling and Extraction (NORA) Project

## Introduction

The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) awarded Ecomole, s.r.o. the contract titled "Novel foods Risk Assessment Data Modelling and Extraction" (Contract No: NP/EFSA/NIF/2023/03). This project aims to aid EFSA in enhancing risk analysis capabilities by improving the quality, interoperability, and usability of data related to novel foods (NF).

## Background

**Contractor**: EcoMole s.r.o.  
**Awarding Body**: EFSA (European Food Safety Authority)

## Project Overview

The NORA project focuses on three primary objectives:
1. **Data Modelling**: Develop a comprehensive data model for the risk assessment of NF dossiers.
2. **Data Extraction**: Extract relevant data from existing EFSA opinions on novel food applications.
3. **Guideline for Data Entry**: Create guidelines for consistent future data entry, ensuring data quality and usability.

## Data and Methodologies

### Data Sources

The project utilizes publicly available novel food opinions published by EFSA, including safety assessments of various food sources such as mung bean protein, nicotinamide riboside chloride, and oil from Schizochytrium limacinum.

### Methodology

The project comprises several phases:
- **Data Modelling**: Developing a structured data model using existing frameworks like OpenFoodTox 2.0, IUCLID, and OECD Harmonised Templates.
- **Data Extraction**: Implementing methodologies for efficient data extraction from NF opinions.
- **Guideline Development**: Formulating comprehensive guidelines for data entry based on the developed data model.

### Tools and Technologies

- **Django & Django REST Framework**: For backend API development.
- **Vue.js 3 & Vite**: Employed for efficient frontend development.
- **Vuetify**: Utilized for UI components in Vue.js applications.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests from the frontend.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For secure authentication mechanisms.
- **HTTPS**: Ensured for secure communication between client and server.

## Results and Impact

Preliminary results demonstrate the effective translation of the OFT 2.0 design into the new NORA data model, aligning with the unique requirements of novel food assessments. This project is expected to significantly enhance the efficiency and accuracy of risk assessments for novel foods within EFSA.

## Documentation

Further documentation, including the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and detailed project methodologies, is provided in the appendices.
