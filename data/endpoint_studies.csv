EFSA-Q-2021-00475,dried flowers of Clitoria ternatea L.,literature,subchronic,,ethanolic extract ,90 days,rat,Unspecified,NOAEL,,1000,Milligrams per kilogram body weight per day,EFSA noted that the concentration of cyclotides in the tested extract (1 mg/g) is about 20 to 50 times lower than the concentrations of cyclotides reported in the TF and that it is unclear whether and to which extent the test material used in this study was representative for the TF. EFSA considers therefore that the NOAEL reported for this study is not suitable to derive a safe intake level for humans for this TF.
